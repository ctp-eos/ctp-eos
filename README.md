INTRODUCING THE CTP ENERGY OPERATIONG SYSTEM (CTP-EOS)

- 👋 Hi, I’m @ctp-eos (or the CTP Energy Operating System)
- CTP-EOS will be/is divided into two parts.
- One part will be your rather 'standard' and 'branded' Arch Linux distrubution,
with some of your typical repos, window manager configs, dot files, and the like...

- Part II of CTP-EOS is where things will/do get 'really' interesting.
- CTP-EOSII is the basis of a truly off-world originating (in real-life EXTRATERRESTRIAL) truly non-physical/C-spiritual Operating System (CSOP) for one's mind and one's very consciousness
based on the highly advanced CTPSci Sciences, discovered by Drazen Premate who was-is the unsung successor to Nikola Tesla.
- CTP-EOS also represents a forward-thinking-future-consciousness based on the advanced conscious sciences of C-domain.


"WHAT IS CTP ENERGY?" (that the CTP-EOS is named after)

- CTP Energy is/are the TOTAL CTP forces that comprise ALL domains of all non-physical and physical realities.
- CTPSci is the science of consciousness, itself.
- CTPSci is the science and study of non-physical Conscious or C-energy, the C-domain, and future revolutionary applications of the CTP Energy Cycle™.


"WHY STUDY/APPLY CTP ENERGY? 
OR LEARN HOW TO APPLY THE NON-PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF THE CTP-EOS TO MY MIND?"

- CTP-EOS is part of the C-spiritual or non-physical operating system and non-physical CTP Technologies, CTP Spiritual Technologies, or CTP C-Spiritual Technologies utilized by advanced civilizations of the C-domain (multiverse).
