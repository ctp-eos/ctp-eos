### INTRODUCING THE CTP ENERGY OPERATING SYSTEM *(CTP-EOS)*

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ctp-eos *(or the 'CTP Energy Operating System' or also the 'CTP Extraterrestrial Operating System')*
- CTP-EOS will be/is divided into two parts.

Part 1 part will be your rather 'standard' and 'branded' Arch Linux distribution,
with some of your typical repos, window manager configs, dot files, and the like...

Part II of **CTP-EOS** is where things will/do get 'really' interesting.
- *CTP-EOS* (part II) is the basis of an off-world originating *(in real-life EXTRATERRESTRIAL)* truly non-physical/C-spiritual Operating System (CSOP) for one's mind and one's very consciousness!
- CTP-EOS based on the highly advanced CTPSci Sciences
- Discovered by Drazen Premate who was-is the unsung successor to Nikola Tesla our world missed during his time here.
- CTP-EOS also represents a forward-thinking-future-consciousness based on the advanced consciousness sciences of C-domain.


### WHAT IS CTP ENERGY? *(that the CTP-EOS is named after)*

- CTP Energy is/are the TOTAL CTP forces that comprise ALL domains of all non-physical and physical realities (of existence).
- CTPSci is the science of consciousness, itself.
- CTPSci is the science and study of non-physical Conscious or C-energy, the C-domain, and future revolutionary applications of the CTP Energy Cycleâ„¢.


### WHY STUDY/APPLY CTP ENERGY? 
OR LEARN HOW TO APPLY THE NON-PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF THE CTP-EOS TO MY MIND?"

- CTP-EOS is part of the C-spiritual or non-physical operating system and non-physical CTP Technologies, CTP Spiritual Technologies, or CTP C-Spiritual Technologies utilized by advanced civilizations of the C-domain (multiverse).
- Learning the 'conscious' aspects of the CTPSci Sciences (themselves) will be prerequite(s) in order to properly interface with and utilize advanced CTP Energy Systems and future physical CTP deeptech deeptech technologies of the future.
- Thus, the *'CTP-EOS'* must be learned and applied to one's mind and one's consciousness, many years before the future CTP Energy Systems themselves can ever be realized.
