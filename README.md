- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ctp-eos
- CTP-EOS will be in two parts.
- One part will be your rather 'standard' and 'branded' Arch Linux distrubution,
with some of your typical repos, window manager configs, dot files, and the like...

- Part II of CTP-EOS is where things will get 'really' interesting.
- CTP-EOSII is the basis of a truly non-physical Operating System for one's mind and one's very consciousness
based on the highly advanced CTPSci Sciences, discovered by Drazen who was-is the unsung successor to Nikola Tesla. 

- CTP-EOS also represents a forward-thinking-future-consciousness based on the advanced conscious sciences of C-domain.
